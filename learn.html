    <h2>Learn About Your Skin</h2> 

    <p> 
      Healthy skin starts with understanding how it works. 
      At REPAIR, we believe education is just as important as the products you use. 
      This page helps you learn the basics of skin health so you can build a routine that works best for you long-term.

    <!-- SKin Barrier -->
  <section> 

    <h2>The Skin Barrier</h2> 

    <p> 
      The skin barrier is the outermost layer of your skin that protects against moisture loss, pollution, and irritation. 
      When your barrier is healthy, your skin feels balanced and resilient. 
      When it is damaged, skin may feel dry, sensitive, or inflamed. 
    </p>

    <h2>Why Ingredients Matter</h2> 

    <p> 
      Skincare works best when it is made with proven, well-researched ingredients. 
      We focus on ingredients that support repair and barrier protection rather than quick, temporary results. 
      Good ingredients help:
    </p> 

    <ul class="why-list">
      <li>Support long-term skin repair</li> 
      <li>Strengthen the skin barrier</li> 
      <li>Reduce irritation and dryness</li> 
      <li>Improve overall skin health</li> 
    </ul>

    <!-- Simple Routines -->
  <section> 

    <h2>Simple Skincare Routines</h2> 

    <p> 
      Using more products does not always lead to better skin. 
      A simple routine that you can follow consistently is often more effective than constantly changing products. 
      That is why REPAIR keeps a minimal product line designed to work together.
